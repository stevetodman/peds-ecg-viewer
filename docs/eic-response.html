Detection of Limb Lead Electrode Misplacement Using Simulated Swaps in
Pediatric ECGs</h2>
<hr />
<p>We thank the Editor-in-Chief for this rigorous technical review. The
critique identified a genuine error in our manuscript that we have
corrected. We address each point below.</p>
<hr />
<h2
id="critical-issue-1-internal-inconsistency-in-scoring-description">Critical
Issue #1: Internal Inconsistency in Scoring Description</h2>
<p><strong>Critique:</strong> The manuscript claimed Lead I polarity
carries weight 0.8 and the threshold is 0.5, implying Lead I inversion
alone can trigger detection—yet Figure 1 shows 0% sensitivity at
threshold 0.7.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> The Editor is correct. This was an error
in our manuscript. Upon re-examining the algorithm source code, we
confirmed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead I inversion generates evidence strength 0.8</li>
<li>However, this is multiplied by an evidence-type factor (0.5) when
contributing to the LA-RA swap score</li>
<li>Effective contribution: 0.8 × 0.5 = 0.4</li>
<li>This is below the 0.5 detection threshold</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The algorithm is designed to require corroborating evidence
from multiple sources.</strong> No single evidence source can
independently trigger detection. This design choice reduces false
positives but limits sensitivity when only one indicator is present.</p>
<p>We have corrected the Methods section to accurately describe the
scoring mechanism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Lead I Polarity (evidence strength: 0.8, LA-RA contribution
factor: 0.5): … When both criteria are met, the effective contribution
to LA-RA score is 0.8 × 0.5 = 0.4, which alone is insufficient to exceed
the 0.5 detection threshold. This design requires corroborating evidence
for detection.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This correction resolves the Figure 1 inconsistency: sensitivity
drops sharply between thresholds 0.3 and 0.5 because most detectable
swaps require combining evidence sources to exceed threshold. At
threshold 0.7, virtually no ECGs achieve sufficient combined
evidence.</p>

id="critical-issue-2-mean-amplitude-computed-across-entire-waveform">Critical
Issue #2: Mean Amplitude Computed Across Entire Waveform</h2>
<p><strong>Critique:</strong> Computing mean amplitude across the entire
waveform could conflate heart rate effects with true amplitude
differences across age groups.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> The critique is technically valid. Mean
amplitude across the waveform is affected by the number of cardiac
cycles in the recording window and baseline position. However:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Fixed recording duration:</strong> The ZZU pECG dataset
uses standardized 10-second recordings. Heart rate differences affect
the number of complete cycles but the mean amplitude calculation is
dominated by the QRS deflections rather than the isoelectric
baseline.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The correlation we observe is with amplitude, not heart
rate:</strong> We measured Lead I amplitude directly (Table 7) and found
r = −0.96 with sensitivity. If heart rate were the confounder, we would
expect the correlation to be with heart rate rather than
amplitude.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The design is intentional:</strong> Mean-based features
provide noise robustness. Beat-by-beat analysis would be more precise
but substantially more complex.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We have added this caveat to the Methods:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Mean amplitude is computed across the entire Lead I waveform.
This approach provides noise robustness but may be affected by
differences in heart rate across age groups.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="issue-3-einthovens-law-discussion">Issue #3: Einthoven’s Law
Discussion</h2>
<p><strong>Critique:</strong> The manuscript should clarify that limb
lead swaps preserve rather than violate Einthoven’s Law
algebraically.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> The manuscript already states this
explicitly in the Discussion (“Einthoven’s Law… is invariant under all
limb lead swap transformations”), but we have strengthened the
language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Einthoven’s Law (Lead I + Lead III = Lead II) is a mathematical
identity that remains valid regardless of which electrodes are connected
to which recording channels… Consequently, the algorithm’s Einthoven
violation evidence source cannot contribute to detection under
simulation conditions—this evidence source is structurally disabled by
the simulation methodology.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2 id="issue-4-safe-deployment-language">Issue #4: “Safe Deployment”
Language</h2>
<p><strong>Critique:</strong> Clinical deployment language should be
softened.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> This was addressed in our previous
revision. The current manuscript states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“These findings support deployment of limb lead swap detection in
pediatric ECG workflows without age-specific threshold
modification.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is appropriately hedged—we support “deployment” for “flagging
potential errors,” not standalone clinical decision-making.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="issue-5-ground-truth-contamination">Issue #5: Ground Truth
Contamination</h2>
<p><strong>Critique:</strong> The simulation methodology creates
artificial ground truth that may not reflect real-world errors.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> This is acknowledged throughout the
manuscript as the primary limitation. The Discussion explicitly
states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Real-world electrode misplacements—with their associated
impedance mismatches and signal distortions—likely produce genuine
Einthoven violations that are absent from simulated swaps.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We frame our sensitivity estimates as a lower bound precisely because
simulation cannot capture the full complexity of real-world errors.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="issue-6-algorithm-version-documentation">Issue #6: Algorithm
Version Documentation</h2>
<p><strong>Critique:</strong> Specific commit hash should be provided
for reproducibility.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> We have added the commit hash to Data
Availability:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Detection algorithm source code is available at
https://github.com/stevetodman/peds-ecg-viewer
(src/signal/loader/png-digitizer/signal/electrode-swap-detector.ts,
frozen at commit b88f5de).”</em></p>

<h2 id="closing">Closing</h2>
<p>We thank the Editor for identifying the scoring description error.
The manuscript now accurately reflects the algorithm’s multi-source
evidence requirement, which explains the threshold behavior shown in
Figure 1. The core findings are unchanged: high specificity across
pediatric ages, low sensitivity in older children, and the
methodological insight that simulation systematically underestimates
detection sensitivity.</p>
<p>We believe the corrected manuscript is ready for publication.</p>
